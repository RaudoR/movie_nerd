## What this app does not do

- This app does not have the ability to stream any movies. I do not have the right to any of the i can not stream the in the platform therefore there is no "play" functionality. It is strictly a movie info site where you can see posters, actors and actresses, year released, description... among other information. Each Movie also has a "View on IMDB" button that will take you to this site for more information.

Author/Developer: Raudo Rivas
As the sole Developer of this Project i worked on the front-end aspect as well as backend. I specialize in front-end, i like the way that you can see progress of your work in real time and make adjusments accordingly. This project was built using JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, and AWS for deployment. This was the project that helped me learn the most about APis given that i used OMDB a movie database, and with the API key i had access to 280,000 movies and numerous data sets for my application.
